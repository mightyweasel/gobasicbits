## basicbits (A Go web app, just the basic, but it works)

Sometimes all you want is a template you can follow when you.know != enough.

basicbits gets you up and running fast so you can experiment. Don't waste time, get what you need.

This is something you should take and reshape to your own needs.

I hope you build something awesome.
